            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>Select a cell by clicking on it.
            This will activate it or deactivate it.
            Any activated cell with 2 or 3 neighbors continues living.
            Any deactivated cell with 3 activated neighbors will become activated.
            All other cells will keep their current state.
            To start off I included one of the first patterns I found.
            Just click play and watch it go!

        <h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
        <p > Conway was a genuis mathemitician famous for his contributions to
            mathematics in the fields of group theory, number theory, algebra, geometric topology, 
            theoretical physics, combinatorial game theory, and geometry. He's also famous for his cellular automation he created called the Game of Life. For those unfamiliar
            with cellular automata they are essentially virtual worlds created with arbitrary rules that when played 
            out over continued iterations create fascinating patterns. In this specific world the "living" beings are 
            boxes within a square grid. These boxes can either be alive or dead and this is represented by their current color.
            I'm fascinated by the spontaneous patterns that emerge from this continual iteration of specific rules and so 
            I wanted to re-create it from scratch!
