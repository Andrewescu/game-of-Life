# Game Of Life

This is a simple demonstration of the famous cellular automata by James Conway rendered in the browser via JS canvas.

Create patterns by simply clicking on the boxes in the canvas, and pressing play to see what "life" you made!

It allows for pausing and editing the values. It also features a reset option, as well as a couple pre-loaded patterns.
